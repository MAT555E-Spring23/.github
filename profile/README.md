## MAT555E-Statistical Data Analysis for Computational Sciences  

**Course Instructor:** [Gül İnan](https://gulinan.github.io/)

**Course Summary:**

`MAT555E` is a graduate level course which aims to provide an introduction to commonly used statistical methods for inference and prediction problems in data analysis. The course will harmonize statistical theory and data analysis through examples. This course is designed such that:

  - The methods covered will include supervised learning algorithms with a focus on regression and classification problems and unsupervised learning algorithms with a focus on clustering problems,
  - Extensions of these methods to high-dimensional settings will also be discussed, and
  - Application of these methods to data analysis problems and their software implementation will be done via [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

At the end of the semester, the students are expected:

  - To be fluent in the fundamental principles behind several statistical methods,
  - To be able to apply statistical methods to real life problems and data sets, and
  - To be prepared for more advanced coursework or scientific research in machine learning and related fields.

**Course Prerequisites:**

Since the course also touches on the mathematical and statistical theory behind the methods and uses Python for implementation, this course requires the following background:

 - Knowledge of linear algebra, probability, statistics, and optimization,
 - Familiarity with Python's [Numpy](https://numpy.org/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), [Statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html), and [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) libraries,
 - Familiarity with at least one computational document such as [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/), [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), or [RStudio Quarto](https://quarto.org/), and
 - Familiarity with [Git](https://git-scm.com/) commands and [GitHub](https://github.com/) interface.
